  <title>Differentiation Techniques and Applications</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous chapter we have see how to symbolically compute the derivative of functions.
      In an applied setting we do not always have a simple formula to work with.
      We may have several equations, which are dependent on each other,
      or we may have equations that relate variables in ways that cannot be simplified as a simple function.
      In this chapter we will consider these cases and provide techniques for computing the rate of change.
