  <title>Rate of Change and Derivatives</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Calculus looks at two main ideas, the rate of change of a function and the accumulation of a function,
      along with applications of those two ideas.
      In this course, since we are interested in functions in the financial world,
      we look at those ideas in both the discrete and continuous case.
