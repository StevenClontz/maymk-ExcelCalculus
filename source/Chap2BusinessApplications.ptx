         As we mentioned in the previous chapter, many functions are locally linear,
         so if we restrict the domain the function will appear linear.
         Thus, we often start with linear models when trying to understand a situation.
         In this section, we look at the concepts of supply and demand and market equilibrium.
         For our examples in this section we will assume that the functions are linear in the range we care about.

      <title>Supply and Demand and Market Equilibrium</title>

      <p>
        The normal laws of supply and demand assume we are in a market with many producers and consumers,
        operating independently, all of them looking out for their own best interests.
        We expect that when the price goes up, more producers are willing to sell but fewer consumers are willing to buy.
        Conversely, when the price goes down, fewer producers are willing to sell but more consumers are willing to buy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the example of gasoline prices.
        Different prices will make some areas of exploration and production profitable or not profitable.
        When prices go up, new wells get drilled. If prices go down too far,
        stripper wells cease being profitable and are shut down. From the consumer side,
        when prices go up, more people look at mass transit or getting a more fuel-efficient vehicle.
        When prices go down, it is easier to think about a road trip.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <term>law of supply</term> looks at the economy from the supplier’s point of view.
        Price and quantity available for sale always move in the same direction.
        If the price goes up we can assume that all the old suppliers are still willing to sell at the higher price,
        but some more suppliers may enter the market.  If the price goes down,
        no new suppliers will enter the market, and some old suppliers may leave the market.  For a linear model:
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <p>
          <me>
            \text{slope  of supply curve} = \frac{\text{change in price}}{\text{change in quantity supplied}} =
            \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta q} \gt 0
          </me>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>
        The <term>law of demand</term> looks at the economy from the consumer’s point of view.
        Price and quantity available for sale always move in the opposite direction.
        If the price goes down, we can assume that all the old consumers are still willing to buy at the lower price,
        but some more consumers may enter the market.  If the price goes up, no new consumers will enter the market,
        and some old consumers may leave the market.  For a linear model:
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <p>
          <me>
            \text{slope  of demand curve} = \frac{\text{change in price}}{\text{change in quantity demanded}}=
            \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta q} \lt 0
          </me>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>


      <p>
        When we look at a graph of the supply price graph and the demand price graph on the same graph,
        we know the supply curve goes up as we go left to right, while the demand curve goes down.
        From the properties of lines we know there is a single point where such a pair of lines can intersect.
        It is at the point where the amount of goods offered for a price equals the amount of goods desired for the same price.

            <li>
              <p>
                This intersection of the supply and the demand functions is called the point of <term>market equilibrium</term>,
                or <term>equilibrium point</term>.
              </p>

            <li>

                The standard economic theory says that a free and open market will naturally settle on the equilibrium price.

          <p>
            Suppose <m>q</m> denotes quantity, and the supply price for widgets is given by
            <me>
              \Sprice =\$6+\frac{q}{100}
            </me>.
            We are also told the demand price is given by
            <me>
              \Dprice=\$18-\frac{2q}{100}
            </me>.
            Find the equilibrium price and quantity.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <title>Solution (a)</title>
          <p>
            We have started with an example that we can do by basic algebra without any technology.
            Subtracting the two equations, we see that
            <me>
              0=\$12-\frac{3q}{100}
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some straightforward algebra shows that the equilibrium quantity is 400.
            Substituting back into either equation gives an equilibrium price of $10.
          </p>
        </solution>

        <solution>
          <title>Solution (b)</title>
          <p>
            While we can do this example by hand, we also want to use it to set up a solution with Excel,
            since we may want help on problems where the numbers are not as nice.
            Our plan is to use Goal Seek to find the intersection.
            We need a cell where we can solve the problem by forcing the cell to have a value of zero.
          </p>

          <image width="50%" source="images/sec2-1-2.png"/>

          <p>
            When cell <c>D2</c> is zero, the supply price will be the same as the demand price.
            We now invoke Goal Seek.
          </p>

          <image width="60%" source="images/sec2-1-3.png"/>

          <p>
            As expected, it finds equilibrium when <m>q=400</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        We need to do a bit more work when we are simply given data points and need to find the supply and demand curves.
      </p>


      <example>
        <title>Starting With Data</title>
        <statement>
          <figure>

          </figure>

          <p>
            My market data indicates customers will buy 700 gizmos if they are priced at $13 each.
            If the price rises to $15, they will only buy 500.  If the price is $12 a unit,
            the producers will make 400 gizmos.  If the price rises to $13, they will produce 600 gizmos.
            Assume that the supply and demand curves are linear for between 300 and 1000 gizmos.
            Find the equilibrium point for the gizmo market.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We start by making a chart for the values given. We add a scatterplot so that we can see the values.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-1-4.png"/>

          <p>
            Next we add linear trendlines for both the supply and demand.
            We select the option to show the equations.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-1-5.png"/>

          <p>
            The projected equations are:
            <md>
              <mrow>\Sprice\amp =0.005*\quantity+10</mrow>
              <mrow>\\Dprice\amp =-0.01*\quantity+20</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We set up columns for the projected supply and demand curves.
            We also add a column for the difference so that we can use Goal seek to find the equilibrium point.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-1-6.png"/>

          <p>
            It is then straightforward to see that the equilibrium quantity is 666.67 and the equilibrium price is $13.33.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-1-7.png"/>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        There is one more detail worth noting from this last example.
        Depending on the units used, the slope can be very close to zero.
        If we are selling tens of millions of units for a price under a dollar,
        the change in price of a penny may correspond to a change in quantity of several thousand.
        Make sure to include enough digits for your equation to be meaningful.

            Assume the supply and demand curves are linear for quantities between 600 and 1300.
            Find the best fitting lines for the supply and demand functions.
            Find the equilibrium point.  Make a chart listing how many we can sell for $6.40 and $6.60.
            Remember that sales will be the minimum of the supply and the demand.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            We start by putting the data into a spreadsheet and finding the best fitting lines.
            We select the option to show the equations in the chart.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-1-8.png"/>

          <p>
            The supply and demand functions are:
            <md>
              <mrow>\Sprice \amp =.0032*\quantity+3.44</mrow>
              <mrow>\Dprice \amp =-0.0010*\quantity+7.46</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We add columns for the projected supply and demand prices,
            using the equations obtained from the best fitting lines.
            We also add a column, and compute the difference of the supply and demand functions.
            We can now use goal seek to solve the problem.
          </p>

          <image width="60%" source="images/sec2-1-9.png"/>

          <p>
            We now use Goal Seek to find the equilibrium point.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-1-10.png"/>

          <p>
            At equilibrium we sell 956 gizmos at $6.50.
            To find sales at $6.40 and $6.60, we use Goal Seek to get those values at both supply and demand prices.
          </p>

          <image width="50%" source="images/sec2-1-11.png"/>

          <p>
            We see that we can sell 1055 gizmos at $6.40, but can only obtain 925.
            Thus our sales at $6.40 will be 925.  At $6.60 we can obtain 987 gizmos, but can only sell 855.
            Thus our sales at $6.60 will be 855.
            We can eliminate a step in this process if we recall that below equilibrium price the constraint is supply,
            while above equilibrium price the constraint will be demand.

            I am given <m>p=-2 q+100</m> and <m>p=3 q-30</m>,
            as my supply and demand curves, but am not told which is which.
            Determine which curve is the supply curve and explain how you did it.
            What limits can you put on the domain of the supply and demand functions?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The supply function is always increasing (positive slope) and the demand function is always decreasing (negative slope),
            so we have:
            <md>
              <mrow>\text{demand:  }   p \amp =-2 q+100</mrow>
              <mrow>\text{supply:  }   p \amp =3 q-30</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We expect both functions to be positive,
            because negative prices would indicate we would have to actually give people money to take our product off our hands!
            <md>
              <mrow>-2 q+100\gt 0 \amp \text{  implies }  q\lt 50</mrow>
              <mrow>3 q-30\gt 0 \amp \text{ implies }  q\gt 10</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>So we should only consider quantities between 10 and 50.</p>

                    Once we have the function we create a second table using the functions instead of the initial data.
                    The equations were edited to indicate which one is the supply and which one is the demand function.

        In the last section we looked at the economic model for supply and demand.
        We were particularly interested in the point of market equilibrium.
        In this section we will look at the model for revenue, cost and profit.
        As with the previous section, we will begin with assumptions that make as many things as possible linear.

      <title>Revenue and a review of demand price</title>
      <p>
        The simple model for revenue is
        <me>
          \revenue = \quantity*\price
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, in the previous section we worked with two price functions,
        the supply price and the demand price.
        Since we can only make a sale if the consumer is willing to buy,
        we typically use the demand price in computing revenue.  Our model is now
        <me>
          \revenue = \quantity*\Dprice(\quantity)
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the demand price is a linear function, then revenue is a quadratic function.
      </p>
      <p>
        We previously noted that a linear demand price function has a negative slope.
        We should note the two limiting cases. If the slope of the demand curve is 0,
        the consumers have a fixed price they will pay for however much of the product is available.
        In this case the demand curve is a constant, so the revenue curve will be linear.
        This is referred to as a perfectly elastic market.
        The other limiting case is where the demand is for a fixed amount no matter what the price.
        In this case the demand curve is a vertical line and is not a function,
        so the revenue curve also fails to be a function of quantity.
      </p>

      <image width="60%" source="images/sec2-2-1.png"/>

      <p>
        Obviously, we don’t expect to find the limiting cases in the real world.
        In real world cases the revenue function has a negative coefficient for the quadratic term and is a downward facing parabola.
      </p>

      <image width="60%" source="images/sec2-2-2.png"/>

          <p>
            We have determined that the demand price function for widgets is
            <me>
              \Dprice(q)=10-q/1000
            </me>,
            if the quantity is between 2000 and 8000.
            Find the revenue function and graph it over the region where it is defined.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We set up a chart in Excel with revenue defined as <m>\Sprice * \quantity</m>.
          </p>

          <image width="60%" source="images/sec2-2-3.png"/>

          <p>
            When we graph we note that the scales are quite different for price and revenue.
            Thus we want to use secondary axes to capture the scale of both price and revenue.
            We can also put different labels on the two vertical axes.

    <subsection>
      <title>Cost</title>

      <p>
        Once again we will start with a simplified model for cost.
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                For our (simplified) model we will break costs into <term>fixed costs</term>
                and <term>variable costs</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Fixed costs include the costs of being in business.
                They might include license fees, rent for a store or plant,
                and the cost of furnishings and equipment.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Variable costs are tied to the amount you produce or sell.
                For a manufacturer they might include raw material or labor costs.  For someone in sales they might include the cost of goods.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For our simplified model, we assume that variable costs are proportional to quantity.
                This makes our cost function linear.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For our simplified model <term>variable costs= unit costs*quantity</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Thus <term>costs= fixed costs + unit costs*quantity</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <image width="60%" source="images/sec2-2-5.png"/>

      <example>
        <title>Finding Linear Cost</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We can set up a small gizmo manufacturing shop for $6,000.
            The raw materials for producing gizmos cost $14 per unit.
            Find the cost function for gizmo production.
            Find the cost of producing 2500 gizmos.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The fixed costs are the <m>y</m> value of the <m>y</m>-intercept of the cost function.
            The per unit material cost is the slope of the function.  We have
            <me>
              \cost=6000+14*\quantity
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we substitute 2500 for the quantity, our costs are
            <me>
              \cost(2500)=6000+14*2500=41000
            </me>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Profit</title>
      <p>
        For the third piece of the model, we look at profit.  We have the simple formula
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <p>
          <me>
            \profit = \revenue - \cost
          </me>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>
        For our simple examples where cost is linear and revenue is quadratic,
        we expect the profit function to also be quadratic, and facing down.
        We will obviously be interested in the spots where the profit function either crosses the axis or reaches a maximum.
      </p>

      <example>
        <title>Finding Profit</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We are interested in selling widgets.  The demand price function is
            <me>
              \Dprice=15-\frac{q}{1000}
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p>
            It will cost $10,000 to keep our shop open before we consider the price of inventory.
            Our variable cost is the cost of buying the widgets from our wholesaler who will sell them to us for $8 a unit.
            Find a function for profit as a function of how many units we sell.
            Graph that function for quantities from 1000 to 10000.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            Using the methods from the previous examples, we write down the functions for revenues and costs.
            <md>
              <mrow>\revenue \amp = \quantity*\price</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp =q*(15-\frac{q}{1000})</mrow>
              <mrow>\text{costs} \amp = \text{fixed costs} + \text{variable costs}*\quantity</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp =10000+8*q</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now we find profit as the difference of revenue and cost.
            <md>
              <mrow>\profit = q*(15-\frac{q}{1000})-(10000+8q)</mrow>
              <mrow>\profit= \frac{-q^2}{1000}+7q-10000</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We then use Excel to make a chart of values and a graph.
          </p>

          <image width="60%" source="images/sec2-2-7.png"/>
        </solution>

    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Break-Even Point</title>
      <p>
        The last example illustrates a reality of manufacturing and retail.
        If a business has a fixed cost or startup expense, it will have a loss if it does not sell enough.
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <p>
          The point at which revenues equal expenses (cost) is called the <term>break-even point</term>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>
        This is important in preparing a business proposal,
        because the bank will want to know if the break even point is a reasonable amount before it lends any money.
      </p>

      <example>
        <title>Find Break-Even Points</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find break-even points for previous example.
            Explain what those points mean in practical terms.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>We look at the chart from the previous example.</p>

          <image width="60%" source="images/sec2-2-8.png"/>

          <p>
            We can find break-even points by using Goal Seek and setting profit to 0 while changing quantity.
            In this case, we see that we have break-even points when the quantity is 2000 or 5000,
            since those numbers were already on our chart.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first break even point tells us that, if our price is more than
            $13.00, we will not attract enough customers to be able to turn a profit.
            The second break even point says that is we bring our price down below $10,
            we will bring in enough customers, but our revenue will not cover expenses.

            We have the following data from the gizmo market, with quantity and costs measured in millions.

          <p>
            Assuming that price and cost are well modeled by linear equations,
            find the break-even points and explain what they mean with units included in the explanation.
          </p>

          <p>
            To find the break-even point when we are given data instead of an equation, we usually follow this procedure:
            Find the best fitting equations for price and cost.
            From those equations, produce formulas for revenue and profit.
            Use the formulas to find the break-even points using either algebra or Excel.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We put the data into Excel and ask for best fitting lines.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-2-9.png"/>

          <p>
            This produces the desired cost and price functions.

            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We enter these functions in new columns in the spreadsheet and then compute projective
            revenues and profit.  We then use Goal Seek to find places where the projected profit is 0.
            The first break-even point tells us that we expect to break even if we sell 1.83 million units.
            We can do that by setting the price at $16.05.  The second break-even point is at
            14.15 million units.  We reach that sales volume by lowering the price to $6.45.
            While we will have gained market share, we will no longer be making a profit.

      <title>Technical note</title>
      <p>
        In business situations we often have cases where a change of
        quantity in the thousands only changes prices by pennies.  Then, our coefficients are close
        to zero, and Excel may give formulas rounded to zero.  In those cases we need to format the
        trendline to get more digits of accuracy.

            These equations have only one digit of accuracy.
            In general, that will not be accurate enough.

            We enter these functions in new columns in the spreadsheet and then compute
            projective revenues and profit.  We then use Goal Seek to find places where the
            projected profit is 0.  The first break-even point goes from 1.83 million at price of $16.05 to 1.82 million at a price of $1602.
            The second break even point goes from 14.15 million units at a price to $6.45 to 13.75 million at a price of $6.48.

          <p>
            Mary has been put in charge of a school function.
            She estimates that there is a fixed cost of $1000 for the site plus a cost of $5 per person that attends.
            If she charges $15 a ticket she can sell 250 tickets,
            but if she lowers the price to $10 she can sell 500 tickets.
            Assuming the demand price is linear, what price should she charge to break even while maximizing attendance?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The description of the cost function states that the fixed cost is $1000,
            and the variable cost is $5, so the cost function is <m>\cost=5 q+1000</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two points are given for the price function: <m>(q_1  ,p_1 )=(250,15)</m> and <m>(q_2  ,p_2 )=(500,10)</m>.
            Hence the slope is <m>m=  (15-10)/(250-500)= -5/250= -1/50=-0.02</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the demand price function is <m>(p-p_0 )= m (q-q_0)</m> Hence
            <md>
              <mrow>(p-15) \amp = -0.02 (q-250)</mrow>
              <mrow>p \amp =15 -0.02 (q-250)</mrow>

        For most of this chapter, we have restricted ourselves to functions that were either linear functions or polynomial functions where they are built from the interaction of linear functions.  While this makes the economic models easier to understand, it is pretty clear that the situations we care about are often better described by more complicated functions.  Suppliers of gasoline have a finite amount they can deliver regardless of the price.  That leads to a very nonlinear supply function.  It is worthwhile to review how we would enter other functions in a spreadsheet.

        Consider a demand function and why it is probably not linear.
        We expect demand to go up whenever we drop the price.
        However, with a linear function, if dropping the price from $100 t0 $50 increases the demand by 20 from 100 to 120, 
        then decreasing the price from $50 to $0 and giving it away would only increase demand by another 20 to 140.
        A more reasonable model may be a power function where decreasing the price by a fixed percentage increases consumption by a fixed percentage.
        Similarly, when we think about the supply function,
        we often expect the limits on available materials to make increasing the supply progressively more expensive.
      </p>

            We are interested in selling gizmos.  The most a consumer will pay is $1,000.
            If we drop the cost by 10\%, we increase demand by 100.
            The cheapest that a supplier will sell for is $200.
            We find the market will produce another 100 gizmos whenever we increase the price by 20%.
            Find the market equilibrium.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We start by converting our information about supply and demand into equations,
            plugging the equations into Excel, and sketching a graph.
            We then use Goal Seek to find where the two equations are equal.
            <md>
              <mrow>\Dprice(\quantity)\amp =1000*(0.9)^{(\quantity/100)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\Sprice(\quantity)\amp =200*(1.2)^{(\quantity/100)}</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <image width="90%" source="images/sec2-3-1.png"/>

          <p>
            We see that the equilibrium price is at $554.64.  At that price the supply and demand will both be 559.45.

          <p>
            We have reason to believe that my demand price is a power function of some kind.
            Our cost function is close to linear,
            but we can get volume discounts and reduce the per-unit cost with larger quantities.
            Thus, we expect my cost function is actually quadratic, with the quadratic term much smaller than the linear term.
            Find best fitting curves for cost and price.  Derive functions for revenue and profit.
            Find break-even points between 10 and 1500.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            I start by finding best-fit curves of for cost and price.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-3-2.png"/>

          <p>Thus we have:
            <md>
              <mrow>\cost(q) \amp =-0.0028q^2+14.353q+968.13</mrow>
              <mrow>\price(q) \amp =286.02 q^{-0.453}</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, we follow our models to get equations for revenue and profit.
            <md>
              <mrow>\revenue(q) \amp =q*\price(q)=q 286.02 q^{-0.453}=286.02 q^{0.547}</mrow>
              <mrow>\profit(q) \amp = \revenue(q)-\cost(q)=286.02 q^{0.547}+0.0028q^2-14.353q-968.13</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, we load these equations back into Excel and use Goal Seek to find the break-even points.
            Looking at projected profit on the chart we see a sign change near 1000,
            so we suspect a break-even point there.  We also note that profit seems to be going up until <m>q</m> is about 300,
            so I test for a break-even point for small values of <m>q</m>.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-3-3.png"/>

          <p>We see we have break-even points when q is 12.74 and 996.28.</p>

      <title>Discontinuous Functions</title>

      <p>
        All of the functions above have graphs without breaks.
        In mathematical terms, they are continuous functions.
        When we are modeling real world phenomena, we also want to use functions that have breaks in the graph.
        Paint is typically bought in gallon containers,
        so the price to paint a room is based on the number of gallons rounded up to the next whole number.
        Many businesses will give a volume discount to their best customers,
        so there is one price for small quantities and a different price for large quantities.
        The cost of labor changes if overtime pay is involved.
        In all of these cases, the graph has a break in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Excel has several discontinuous functions that are of use to us.

      <p>
        The functions ROUND, ROUNDUP, and ROUNDDOWN are all used for rounding.
        They have a second argument that specifies the number of digits to which we are rounding.
        It should be noted that Excel understands up and down as away from zero for negative numbers.
        Thus it will round <m>-1.5</m> up to <m>-2</m>.
        The CEILING and FLOOR functions also do rounding, but with some different features.
        Instead of specifying the number of digits in the answer,
        these functions round to a multiple of the second argument.
        As expected, CEILING rounds to the next higher multiple, and FLOOR rounds to the next lower multiple.

            The raw material needed to build widgets is sold in blocks that will make 100 widgets.
            A block costs $1000.  The labor cost for building a widget is $7.
            The fixed costs for widget production is $10,000.
            Find a formula for the costs of producing widgets.
            Find the cost of producing 998 and 1009 widgets.
            You should also find the cost per unit at those quantities.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            To make the worksheet easier to follow, we break costs into three pieces,
            fixed costs labor costs, and materials costs.
            The fixed coasts are constant, and the labor costs are linear.
            For the materials costs we need to use the CEILING function to round the number of widgets up to the next even 100,
            then divide by 100 to obtain the number of blocks of raw material we want to buy.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-3-5.png"/>

          <p>
            When we look at the numbers we see that the total cost of producing 998 widgets is $26,986 and the cost of producing 1009 widgets is $28,063.
            When we look at the unit costs, we expect the cost per unit to generally go down as we produce more,
            since the fixed costs are distributed over more units.  However the per unit cost is $27.04 when we produce 998 widgets,
            but that goes up to $28.81 when we make 1009 widgets, since we had to buy another block of raw material.

        The IF command is used when we use different formulas for different cases.
        Some easy examples are overtime pay, benefits costs, and volume discount.
        In many work situations employees are paid one rate up to a certain amount of work and a second rate for additional work.
        It is also common for full time employees to receive certain benefits, like retirement,
        that are not offered to part time employees.
        It is also common for certain industries to offer different rates for their biggest and best customers.
        The basic syntax of the IF command is:
      </p>

      <assemblage>
        <p>
          IF(test condition, value if condition is true, value if condition is false)
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>The values for true and false can be numbers, string, or formulas to evaluate.</p>

            I am a bookkeeper at a small firm.
            Company policy pays the employees time and a half for working more than 40 hours per week.
            I need to compute the weekly pay of 5 employees.
            The employees worked 35, 42, 43, 38, and 42.5 hours.
            Their base pay rates were respectively $8, $9, $10, $11, and $12 an hour.
            Compute the pay for each employee.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            In setting up the worksheet, I will separate regular pay from overtime pay.
            The regular pay is the base rate times the hours worked,
            unless the employee worked more than 40 hours, in which case it is the base rate times 40.
            Overtime pay is the base pay times 1.5 times the number of overtime hours.
            Since overtime cannot be negative, we use the maximum of 0 and hours worked minus 40.

        If our functions are discontinuous,
        we need to exercise a bit of care with our economic models and the points of interest we have been finding.
        The market equilibrium and break-even points are both places where two functions are equal.
        When the mathematics does not give us a clear answer, we should think about the problem and consider what answer makes the most sense.
        Consider a simplified example to illustrate the point.

            In the widget market, the supply is constrained.
            Obtaining more than 2 widgets means using a more expensive process.
            My supply and demand curves are:
            <md>
              <mrow>\Dprice(q)=4-q/2</mrow>
              <mrow>\Sprice(q)=\begin{cases}

                                             1q/2+3&amp;q&gt;2\\

          <p>Find the market equilibrium price.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We would like to find the place where the two curves cross.
            However when we look at a graph of the two functions we see that they never meet.
          </p>

          <image width="60%" source="images/sec2-3-9.png"/>

          <p>
            It is clear from the graph that the market should reach equilibrium at a quantity of 2,
            but it is not clear what the equilibrium price should be.
            We need to do some reasoning about the behavior described by the equations.
            From our formula, the supply price for 2 widgets is $2.
            However if we look at the supply prices of <m>2+h</m> for small values of <m>h</m>,
            we see that the limit of the supply price from above is $4.
            In practical terms the suppliers will produce 2 widgets for any price from $2 to $4.
            If we offer $2, they are also willing to produce 2 widgets.
            If we offer a price of $3.95, they are still only willing to produce 2 widgets.
            The suppliers will be thus willing to produce 2 widgets at a price of $3.
            The equilibrium price is 3.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we want to look at the graph in Excel, it is useful to plot points very close to the discontinuity on both sides.
            For this problem, we might look at both 2 and 2.0001.
          </p>

          <image width="80%" source="images/sec2-3-10.png"/>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        A lesson to remember is that we need to pay attention to places where our functions are discontinuous and that we need to understand what our economic model should do when the curves do not cross.
        For example, we will understand the break-even point to be the first point where revenue is greater than or equal to costs.
        In the continuous case, this reduces to our old definition.

              Using Excel trendlines, we use the polynomial of order 2 approximation for cost:

            </p>
            <p>
              We use the exponential approximation for demand price:
              <me>\Dprice = 199.78e^{(-0.0003x)}</me>.

                  <p>
                    We can add another column to find the values of the respective functions when <m>q_0=300</m>.</p>
                    <p>Demand price = $ 182.59, cost = $39,928.20, revenue = $54,775.55 and profit = $14,847.35.</p>
