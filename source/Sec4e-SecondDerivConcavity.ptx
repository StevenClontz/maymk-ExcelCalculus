    <title>The Second Derivative and Concavity</title>

    <p>
      For an intuitive definition of the derivative, we talked about zooming in on the graph until it looks like a straight line and taking the slope.
      For concavity, we want to zoom out a bit, so the graph curves up or down from a line.
    </p>

    <p>
      We say that a graph is concave up if the line between two points is above the graph,
      or alternatively if the first derivative is increasing.  (In finance, such a curve is said to be convex.)
      Similarly, we say that a graph is concave down if the line between two points is below the graph,
      or alternatively if the first derivative is decreasing.  (In finance, such a curve is said to be concave.)

    <p>
      In determining is a curve is concave up or concave down,
      we want to take the second derivative of a function, or the derivative of the derivative.

          For a function <m>f(x)</m>, the <term>second derivative</term> of <m>f(x)</m> or the derivative of <m>f'(x)</m>,
          denoted as <m>f''(x)</m>,   is defined as
          <me>
            f''(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{d}{dx}\left( f(x)\right)\right)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      We also want to recall some alternate notations we may use.

        <alert>Notation</alert>:  Let <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second derivative of <m>f(x)</m>  is denoted as <m>f''(x)</m> or
        <m>\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x)</m> or <m>\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second derivative at <m>x=x_0</m> is denoted as <m>f''(x_0 )</m> or
        <m>\left.\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\right|_{x=x_0}</m>.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      As we have noted before, when there are several forms, we use the one that makes the most sense in the case on which we are working.

      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>As the last problem shows, it is often useful to simplify between taking the first and second derivatives.</p>

    <p>
      If our function is the position of <m>x</m>, then the first derivative is the rate of change or the <term>velocity</term> of <m>f(x)</m>.
      The second derivative is <term>acceleration</term> or how fast velocity changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Graphically, the first derivative gives the slope of the graph at a point.
      The second derivative tells whether the curve is concave up or concave down at that point.
      If the second derivative is positive at a point, the graph is bending upwards at that point.
      Similarly, if the second derivative is negative, the graph is concave down.
      This is of particular interest at a critical point where the tangent line is flat and concavity tells us if we have a relative minimum or maximum.
    </p>

      <title>Second derivative test of extrema</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function with <m>f'(x_0)=0</m>.
        Then if <m>f''(x_0) \gt 0</m>, the function has a local minimum at <m>x=x_0</m>.
        If <m>f''(x_0) \lt 0</m>, the function has a local maximum at <m>x=x_0</m>.
        If <m>f''(x_0)=0</m>, the second derivative test fails and we cannot tell if we have a local maximum, local minimum, or neither.

      <p>
        The mathematical first and second derivatives are used in pricing various financial products and options that are also called derivatives.
        The first derivative is used to give a value to whether the underlying product has a price that goes up or down.
        It looks at the slope of the pricing curve.  The second derivative is used to give a value to the volatility of the underlying product.
        It looks at how much the pricing curve bends.  We will return to these uses when we look at integrals.

              Note that local maximums of a function must correspond to zeroes of its derivative.
              The original function is F (green).   Its derivative is D (Purple).

            For the next set of problems, you need to know the formula for the price of a zero coupon bond given the face value,
            the interest rate, and the time to maturity.  For such instruments we use the formula
            <me>\cost=\frac{\FaceValue}{(1+\rate)^{\years}}</me>.
            (Be aware that a rate of 4% is a rate of 0.04.)
          </p>
          <p>
            For each problem give:
            <ol marker="(a)">
              <li><p>The cost of the bond as described.</p></li>
              <li><p>The first derivative of cost as a function of rate. (This measures risk of interest rate change.)</p></li>
              <li><p>The second derivative of cost as a function of rate.  (This measures the value of an option on the bond.)</p></li>
